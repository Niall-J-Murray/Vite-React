            <div className="text-block">
                <p>
                    Slipstream is a fantasy sports game based on the real-world
                    Formula 1 championship.
                    <br/>
                    Most fantasy sports games are aimed at existing fans of the
                    sport, so research and frequent team management gives players an
                    advantage.
                    <br/>
                    To balance this, Slipstream introduces an element of luck and
                    limits the need to constantly manage your team, so that those
                    who know the sport better don't have too much advantage if luck
                    is not on their side.

                    It uses a draft pick format, so that no two players/teams in the
                    same league can have the same driver. Once all the drivers are
                    picked, the league is live and no changes can be made until the
                    end of the season.
